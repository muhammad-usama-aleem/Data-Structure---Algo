SQL Notes

SQL Subsets:
there are four subsets of SQL
1- Data Defination Language (DDL)
2- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
3- Data Query Language (DQL)
4- Data Control Language (DCL)


1- Data Defination Language (DDL):
   To define data in database using,
i)   CREATE: to define data in database, like table
ii)  ALter: to modify the table like add a new column in table.
iii) Drop: to drop data from table, like removing a row from database.

2- Data Manipulation Language (DML):
   To maipulate data which is already defined in database
i)   Insert: used to insert data in the table, like adding a new row data in the table
ii)  Update: to update the data in the rows, like updating an entity in the row of a table
iii) Delete: to delete one or more rows of data from a table

3- Data Query Language (DQL):
   To read data from the database, we use DQL
i)   Select: to select the data, one or many rows, from database based on filters applied

4- Data Control Language (DCL):
   To control access to the database
i)  GRANT: to gives users access privileges to the database.
ii) REVOKE: to withdraws the userâ€™s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.


1- DDL
CREATE Command

Purpose: To create the database or tables inside the database

            CREATE DATABASE database_name;
e.g: CREATE DATABASE college

# create a table in db
            CREATE TABLE table_name;
            CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 datatype(size), column_name2 datatype(size), column_name3 datatype(size));
e.g: CREATE TABLE student

## DROP Command 

Purpose: To delete a database or a table inside the database. 

Syntax to drop a table:

            DROP TABLE table_name; 

## ALTER Command 

Purpose: To change the structure of the tables in the database such as changing the name of a table, adding a primary key to a table, or adding or deleting a column in a table.

      1. Syntax to add a column into a table:

            ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name datatype(size)); 

      2. Syntax to add a primary key to a table:

            ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (column_name);

## TRUNCATE Command

Purpose: To remove all records from a table, which will empty the table but not delete the table itself. 

Syntax to truncate a table:

            TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

## COMMENT Command

Purpose: To add comments to explain or document SQL statements by using double dash (--) at the start of the line. Any text after the double dash will not be executed as part of the SQL statement. These comments are not there to build the database. They are only for your own use.   

Syntax to COMMENT a line in SQL: 

            --Retrieve all data from a table
            SELECT * FROM table_name; 

2- DML
## SELECT Command

Purpose: To retrieve data from tables in the database. 

Syntax to select data from a table:

            SELECT * FROM table_name;


## INSERT Command

Purpose: To add records of data into an existing table. 
Syntax to insert data into three columns in a table:

            INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);


## UPDATE Command 

Purpose: To modify or update data contained within a table in the database. 

Syntax to update data in two columns:

            UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;


## DELETE Command

Purpose: To delete data from a table in the database.

Syntax to delete data:

            DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

3- DCL
You use DCL to deal with the rights and permissions of users of a database system. You can execute SQL commands to perform different types of operations such as create and drop tables. To do this, you need to have user rights set up. This is called user privileges. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in the database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

GRANT: Command to provide the user of the database with the privileges required to allow users to access and manipulate the database.

REVOKE: Command to remove permissions from any user.

4- TCL
The TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by utilizing the DML commands. It also allows SQL statements to be grouped together into logical transactions. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in a database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

COMMIT: Command to save all the work you have already done in the database. 

ROLLBACK: Command to restore a database to the last committed state.
